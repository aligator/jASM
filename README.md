# jASM
Something I did some time ago as experiment -> a interpreter for a custom bytecode

The compiler is unfinished as I remember. But the Bytecode interpreter should work.  
[Instead I created a compiler in Haskell.](https://github.com/aligator/jASMc) which is finished.

[The Problem is that I have a docu about the bytecode only in german and as .odt file (why^^)](https://github.com/aligator/jASM/blob/master/jASM-Bytecode-Interpreter/doc/jASM-description.odt)
