# jASM
Something I did some time ago as experiment -> a interpreter for a custom bytecode

The compiler is unfinished as I remember. But the Bytecode interpreter should work.  
[Instead I created a compiler in Haskell.](https://github.com/aligator/jASMc) which is finished.

The Problem is that I have no exact documentation anymore about how the bytecode looks like...
